Given string s, calculate the maximum deviation of all substrings.
The maximum deviation is the difference between the maximum frequency of a character and the minimum frequency of a character.

For example, in abcaba, a has a frequency of 3; b has a frequency of 2; c has a frequency of 1. so a has the maximum frequency, which is 3, whereas c has a minimum frequency of 1. Therefore the deviation of this string is 3 - 1 = 2. And we also need to find all other deviations for each of the substrings for abacaba, the maximum among them is the answer.
