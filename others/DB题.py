Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.

'''
group by的内容是按它统筹的内容，比如要统计order个数，要按人头算。

union
select cols from B

UNION 内部的 SELECT 语句必须拥有相同数量的列。列也必须拥有相似的数据类型。同时，每条 SELECT 语句中的列的顺序必须相同。
A：a, b, c
B: d, e, f
union结果：a,b,c,d,e,f
